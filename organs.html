            Equine anatomy encompasses the gross and microscopic anatomy of
            horses, ponies and other equids, including donkeys, mules and
            zebras. While all anatomical features of equids are described in the
            same terms as for other animals by the International Committee on
            Veterinary Gross Anatomical Nomenclature in the book Nomina
            Anatomica Veterinaria, there are many horse-specific colloquial
            terms used by equestrians.

              The forehand is the part of the horse that is in front of the
              rider when in the saddle. The forehand consists of the head, neck,
              shoulders and forelimbs. She receives the indications of the
              superior helpers and gives the direction of the movement. Raising
              the forehand contributes to the balance of the school and fighting
              horse. It is inseparable from the lowering of the hindquarters of
              which it is the consequence. Its extension causes contrary to the
              lengthening of gaits and the displacement of the center of gravity
              of horse and rider forward.

              <br />The horse's head presents few morphological variations,
              probably due to of the herbivorous diet and the digestion
              process1. In particular, the teeth must be positioned in such a
              way as to allow for the horse to graze on plants on the ground1.
              Another particularity of the facial morphology of the horse is the
              role that it plays in matter of intraspecific communication.

                The head profil
              </h2>
              <br />
              A point of morphological differentiation in the horse's head is
              its profile, which can be convex (synonym: curved), rectilinear,
              or concave1 (synonym: camus5). The majority of horses present a
              profile of straight head, or slightly concave1. Convex profiles
              are rarer, and typically associated with Iberian horses and other
              baroque frames1. The Arab is renowned for its head profile
              concave, while the Shire most often has a head profile convex. The
              term "subconvex" designates a head profile with a minor convexity,
              which becomes more evident at the nose1. Certain horses, often
              ponies and breeds from northern countries, have a head that is
              concave at the forehead and convex in its lower part, giving an
              “S” shaped head profile6. We speaks of a “rhinoceros head”, if the
              concavity is limited to the chamfer5, and “mutton head” when only
              the chamfer is convex. The “hare`s head” has a convexity limited
              to the part frontal

            Hindquarters The hindquarters are the part of the horse located
            behind the saddle. It is composed 1,c 1: loins, rump, hips; of the
            hind limbs: thigh, buttock, fold of the buttocks, tip of the
            buttocks, stifle, stifle fold, leg, kneecap, hock, cord of hock,

            cornering, the encamped hindquarters prohibits the retreat, the
            hindquarters suitably lowered and bent allows it to be gathered
            together and the relaxation of the springs in the forward movement.
            The hindquarters lightweight allows maximum galloping speed.

            The foot constitutes the end of the horse's limbs. The other members
            of the genus Equus, donkey and zebra, have the same foot morphology
            which distinguishes them from their equine ancestors. It is an
            essential element of locomotion which fully justifies the expression
            “no foot, no horse”. The horse is a perissodactyl, with an odd
            number of toes - in this case only one - whose body weight is
            supported by the middle toe. In comparative anatomy, the horse's
            foot therefore corresponds to the last two phalanges of the middle
            finger of the human species.
