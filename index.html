              The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated, one-toed,
              hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is
              one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved
              over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed
              creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today.
              Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their
              domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE.
              Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some
              domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These
              feral populations are not true wild horses, which are horses that
              never have been domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized
              vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering
              everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings,
              breeds, locomotion, and behavior. <br />
              Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape
              predators, and possess a good sense of balance and a strong
              fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from
              predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to
              sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending
              to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called
              mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young
              horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth.
              Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a
              harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult
              development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between
              25 and 30 years. Horse breeds are loosely divided into three
              categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods"
              with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and
              some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods",
              developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often
              focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes,
              particularly in Europe. <br />

          There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed
          for many different uses. Horses and humans interact in a wide variety
          of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits as
          well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture,
          entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare,
          from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed,
          using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many
          products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair,
          bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares.
          Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter, as
          well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.
