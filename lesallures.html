    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 90px; margin-bottom: 30px" st>
      Pace. The pace is a lateral two-beat gait. In the pace, the two legs on
      the same side of the horse move forward together, unlike the trot, where
      the two legs diagonally opposite from each other move forward together. In
      both the pace and the trot, two feet are always off the ground.

        The walk
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-left: 90px">
        The walk is a four-beat gait that averages about 7 kilometres per hour
        (4.3 mph). When walking, a horse's legs follow this sequence: left hind
        leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, in a regular
        1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will alternate between having three
        or two feet on the ground. A horse moves its head and neck in a slight
        up and down motion that helps maintain balance.

          The trot is a two-beat diagonal horse gait where the diagonal pairs of
          legs move forward at the same time with a moment of suspension between
          each beat. It has a wide variation in possible speeds, but averages
          about 13 kilometres per hour (8.1 mph). A very slow trot is sometimes
          referred to as a jog. An extremely fast trot has no special name, but
          in harness racing, the trot of a Standardbred is faster than the
          gallop of the average non-racehorse, and has been clocked at over 30
          miles per hour (48 km/h).

        On June 29, 2014, at Pocono Downs in Pennsylvania the Swedish
        standardbred Sebastian K trotted a mile in 1 minute, 49 seconds
        (quarters were passed at 26:2, 55:3 and 1,21:4). This is equivalent to a
        1000-pace in 1.07,7 or 53.14 kilometers per hour or 33 miles per hour.
        From the standpoint of the balance of the horse, the trot is a very
        stable gait and does not require the horse to make major balancing
        motions with its head and neck.[1] Due to its many variations, the trot
        is a common gait that the horse is worked in for dressage. Eadweard
        Muybridge was the first to prove, by photography, in 1872 that there is
        a "moment of suspension" or "unsupported transit" during the trot gait.

        The galop
      </h2>
      <div class="galop">
        <p style="width: 70%; margin-bottom: 20px">
          The gallop is very much like the canter, except that it is faster,
          more ground-covering, and the three-beat canter changes to a four-beat
          gait. It is the fastest gait of the horse, averaging about 40 to 48
          kilometres per hour (25 to 30 mph), and in the wild is used when the
          animal needs to flee from predators or simply cover short distances
          quickly. Horses seldom will gallop more than 1.5 to 3 kilometres (0.9
          to 2 mi) before they need to rest, though horses can sustain a
          moderately paced gallop for longer distances before they become winded
          and have to slow down. The gallop is the gait of the classic race
          horse. Modern Thoroughbred horse races are seldom longer than 1.5
          miles (2.4 km), though in some countries Arabian horses are sometimes
          raced as far as 2.5 miles (4.0 km). The fastest galloping speed is
          achieved by the American Quarter Horse, which in a short sprint of a
          quarter mile (0.25 miles (0.40 km)) or less has been clocked at speeds
          approaching 55 miles per hour (88.5 km/h). The Guinness Book of World
          Records lists a Thoroughbred as having averaged 43.97 miles per hour
          (70.76 km/h) over a two-furlong (0.25 miles (402 m)) distance in 2008.
          Like a canter, the horse will strike off with its non-leading hind
          foot; but the second stage of the canter becomes, in the gallop, the
          second and third stages because the inside hind foot hits the ground a
          split second before the outside front foot. Then both gaits end with
          the striking off of the leading leg, followed by a moment of
          suspension when all four feet are off the ground. A careful listener
          or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence
          of the fourth beat.

          According to Equix, who analyzed the biometrics of racing
          Thoroughbreds, the average racing colt has a stride length of 24.6
          feet (7.5 m); that of Secretariat, for instance, was 24.8 feet (7.6
          m), which was probably part of his success. A controlled gallop used
          to show a horse's ground-covering stride in horse show competition is
          called a "gallop in hand" or a hand gallop. In complete contrast to
          the suspended phase of a gallop, when a horse jumps over a fence, the
          legs are stretched out while in the air, and the front legs hit the
          ground before the hind legs. Essentially, the horse takes the first
          two steps of a galloping stride on the take-off side of the fence, and
          the other two steps on the landing side. A horse has to collect its
          hindquarters after a jump to strike off into the next stride.
