          ShowJumping
        </h2>
        <p class="anap" style="font-size: 25px">
          Show jumping is a part of a group of English riding equestrian events
          that also includes eventing, hunters, and equitation. Jumping classes
          are commonly seen at horse shows throughout the world, including the
          Olympics. Sometimes shows are limited exclusively to jumpers.
          Sometimes jumper classes are offered in conjunction with other
          English-style events. Sometimes, show jumping is but one division of a
          very large, all-breed competition that includes a very wide variety of
          disciplines. Jumping classes may be governed by various national horse
          show sanctioning organizations, such as the United States Equestrian
          Federation or the British Showjumping Association. International
          competitions are governed by the rules of the International Federation
          for Equestrian Sports.

          Dressage
        </h2>
        <p class="dressagep">
          Dressage is a form of horse riding performed in exhibition and
          competition, as well as an art sometimes pursued solely for the sake
          of mastery. As an equestrian sport defined by the International
          Equestrian Federation, dressage is described as "the highest
          expression of horse training" where "horse and rider are expected to
          perform from memory a series of predetermined movements". Competitions
          are held at all levels from amateur to the Olympic Games and World
          Equestrian Games. Its fundamental purpose is to develop, through
          standardized progressive training methods, a horse's natural athletic
          ability and willingness to perform, thereby maximizing its potential
          as a riding horse. At the peak of a dressage horse's gymnastic
          development, the horse responds smoothly to a skilled rider's minimal
          aids. The rider is relaxed and appears effort-free while the horse
          willingly performs the requested movement. The discipline has a rich
          history with ancient roots in the writings of Xenophon. Modern
          dressage has evolved as an important equestrian pursuit since the
          Renaissance when Federico Grisone's "The Rules of Riding" was
          published in 1550, one of the first notable European treatises on
          equitation since Xenophon's On Horsemanship. Much about training
          systems used today reflects practices of classical dressage. In modern
          dressage competition, successful training at the various levels is
          demonstrated through the performance of "tests", prescribed series of
          movements ridden within a standard arena. Judges evaluate each
          movement on the basis of a standard appropriate to the level of the
          test and assign each movement a score from zero to ten zero being "not
          executed" and 10 being "excellent". A competitor achieving all 6s (or
          60% overall) might typically then move up to the next level.

          Racing
        </h2>
        <p class="racingp" style="font-size: 25px">
          Horse racing is an equestrian performance activity, typically
          involving two or more horses ridden by jockeys (or sometimes driven
          without riders) over a set distance for competition. It is one of the
          most ancient of all sports, as its basic premise to identify which of
          two or more horses is the fastest over a set course or distance has
          been mostly unchanged since at least classical antiquity. Due to
          animal cruelty, companies and individuals are boycotting horse racing
          and it has been steadily declining in popularity worldwide. Horse
          races vary widely in format, and many countries have developed their
          own particular traditions around the sport. Variations include
          restricting races to particular breeds, running over obstacles,
          running over different distances, running on different track surfaces,
          and running in different gaits. In some races, horses are assigned
          different weights to carry to reflect differences in ability, a
          process known as handicapping. While horses are sometimes raced purely
          for sport, a major part of horse racing's interest and economic
          importance is in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in
          2019 generated a worldwide market worth around US$115 billion.
